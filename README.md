# 🏃 Midnight Marathon Results Viewer
A simple program to search and filter participant data for the Midnight Marathon. The program allows users to look up registrations by race number and list results based on a time filter. This project was made for my university course in python.

## 📋 Features
1. Lookup Registration:
Search for a participant by their race number and display their name and city.

2. List Results:
Filter and display participants who finished the marathon in a time faster than the user-specified limit. Output includes:

- Race Number
